FINAL RESULTS:

GenyMobile-scrcpy/app/src/sys/unix/command.c:115:  [5] (race) readlink:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files or
  change the link content, a race condition results. Also, it does not
  terminate with ASCII NUL. (CWE-362, CWE-20). Reconsider approach.
GenyMobile-scrcpy/app/src/command.c:107:  [4] (format) sprintf:
  Potential format string problem (CWE-134). Make format string constant.
