FINAL RESULTS:

libexpat/expat/examples/outline.c:64:  [4] (format) printf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited
  (CWE-134). Use a constant for the format specification.
libexpat/expat/lib/xmlparse.c:116:  [4] (shell) system:
  This causes a new program to execute and is difficult to use safely
  (CWE-78). try using a library call that implements the same functionality
  if available.
libexpat/expat/tests/runtests.c:126:  [4] (buffer) sprintf:
  Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120). Use sprintf_s, snprintf, or
  vsnprintf.
libexpat/expat/tests/runtests.c:2361:  [4] (buffer) sprintf:
  Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120). Use sprintf_s, snprintf, or
  vsnprintf.
libexpat/expat/xmlwf/xmltchar.h:42:  [4] (format) fwprintf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited
  (CWE-134). Use a constant for the format specification.
libexpat/expat/xmlwf/xmltchar.h:47:  [4] (buffer) wcscpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using a function version that stops copying at the end
  of the buffer.

  be set more than once (CWE-807, CWE-20). Check environment variables
  carefully before using them.
