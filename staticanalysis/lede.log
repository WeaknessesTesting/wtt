FINAL RESULTS:


scripts/config/confdata.c:104:  [4] (buffer) strcat:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination
  [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Consider using strcat_s, strncat, strlcat, or
  snprintf (warning: strncat is easily misused).
scripts/config/confdata.c:107:  [4] (buffer) strcat:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination
  [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Consider using strcat_s, strncat, strlcat, or
  snprintf (warning: strncat is easily misused).
scripts/config/lxdialog/inputbox.c:56:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy
  easily misused).
scripts/config/lxdialog/util.c:619:  [4] (format) vsnprintf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited,
  and note that sprintf variations do not always \0-terminate (CWE-134). Use
  a constant for the format specification.
scripts/config/mconf.c:777:  [4] (format) vsnprintf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited,
  and note that sprintf variations do not always \0-terminate (CWE-134). Use
  a constant for the format specification.
scripts/config/menu.c:26:  [4] (format) vfprintf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited
  (CWE-134). Use a constant for the format specification.
scripts/config/menu.c:36:  [4] (format) vfprintf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited
  (CWE-134). Use a constant for the format specification.
scripts/config/confdata.c:41:  [4] (format) vfprintf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited
  (CWE-134). Use a constant for the format specification.
scripts/config/confdata.c:50:  [4] (format) vfprintf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited
  (CWE-134). Use a constant for the format specification.
scripts/config/qconf.cc:1086:  [4] (format) sprintf:
  Potential format string problem (CWE-134). Make format string constant.
scripts/config/qconf.cc:1095:  [4] (format) sprintf:
  Potential format string problem (CWE-134). Make format string constant.
scripts/config/qconf.cc:1123:  [4] (format) sprintf:
  Potential format string problem (CWE-134). Make format string constant.
scripts/config/qconf.cc:1146:  [4] (format) sprintf:
  Potential format string problem (CWE-134). Make format string constant.
scripts/config/qconf.cc:1219:  [4] (format) sprintf:
  Potential format string problem (CWE-134). Make format string constant.
scripts/config/qconf.cc:1820:  [4] (format) printf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited
  (CWE-134). Use a constant for the format specification.
scripts/config/symbol.c:684:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy
  easily misused).

scripts/config/util.c:110:  [4] (buffer) strcat:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination
  [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Consider using strcat_s, strncat, strlcat, or
  snprintf (warning: strncat is easily misused).
scripts/config/util.c:120:  [4] (format) vsnprintf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited,
  and note that sprintf variations do not always \0-terminate (CWE-134). Use
  a constant for the format specification.
scripts/config/conf.c:506:  [3] (buffer) getopt_long:
  Some older implementations do not protect against internal buffer overflows
  (CWE-120, CWE-20). Check implementation on installation, or limit the size
  of all string inputs.
scripts/config/conf.c:532:  [3] (buffer) getenv:
  Environment variables are untrustable input if they can be set by an
  attacker. They can have any content and length, and the same variable can
  be set more than once (CWE-807, CWE-20). Check environment variables
  carefully before using them.
scripts/config/conf.c:541:  [3] (random) srand:
  This function is not sufficiently random for security-related functions
  such as key and nonce creation (CWE-327). Use a more secure technique for
  acquiring random values.
scripts/config/conf.c:617:  [3] (buffer) getenv:
  Environment variables are untrustable input if they can be set by an
  attacker. They can have any content and length, and the same variable can
  be set more than once (CWE-807, CWE-20). Check environment variables
  carefully before using them.
scripts/config/lkc.h:42:  [3] (buffer) getenv:

  carefully before using them.
scripts/mkhash.c:800:  [3] (buffer) getopt:
  Some older implementations do not protect against internal buffer overflows
  (CWE-120, CWE-20). Check implementation on installation, or limit the size
  of all string inputs.
